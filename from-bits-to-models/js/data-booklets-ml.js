Practical mitigations include gradient clipping (capping the norm of the gradient vector before applying an update, which directly targets exploding gradients without touching vanishing ones), careful weight initialization to keep the average local derivative near 1 across layers, and, further down this map, residual connections and LSTM/GRU-style gating, which both give gradients a more direct, less-multiplied path back to early layers."

This is not a hypothetical edge case; it recurs constantly whenever a reward function is even slightly misaligned with true intent, which is exactly why reward design is treated as a genuinely hard, first-class problem — and it's precisely the concern the evaluation and alignment booklet returns to at the scale of large language models."

On top of all of that, the activations computed during the forward pass have to be kept around, because the backward pass needs them to compute gradients (exactly the cached intermediate values the backpropagation booklet's forward pass describes, just for a much bigger graph)."
