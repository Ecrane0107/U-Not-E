Saying an algorithm is O(n) does not mean it takes exactly n steps, or even that it is fast — it means that doubling the input roughly doubles the work, for inputs large enough that the trend dominates. O(n²) means doubling the input roughly quadruples the work. What Big-O throws away on purpose is precisely the information that changes with the machine, the language, and the implementation: constant multipliers and one-time overhead."
